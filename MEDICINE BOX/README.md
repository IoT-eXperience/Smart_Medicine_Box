# 📦 ESP32 Box Tilt Detection and Web Dashboard

This project uses an **ESP32** microcontroller and an **ADXL345 accelerometer** to detect the tilt of a box in real-time. The system determines whether the box is "closed" (flat) or "open" (tilted) and displays the results both over **serial** and a **refreshing web interface**. Additionally, a **Python script** is provided to log the tilt data and box status into a CSV file using serial communication.
